Feature: Developer registration
  As the DevRadar API
  I want to register a developer with their GitHub profile and location
  So that they become discoverable to nearby developers

  Background:
    Given the developer database is empty

  @smoke @P1
  Scenario: Register a new developer with a valid GitHub username
    Given "gaearon" is a valid GitHub username
    When I submit a registration with github_username "gaearon", techs "ReactJS, Redux", latitude "-23.5505" and longitude "-46.6333"
    Then the response status should be 200
    And the response should include the developer's name, avatar_url and bio from GitHub
    And the developer's techs should be "ReactJS,Redux"
    And the developer should be persisted with a GeoJSON location of type "Point"

  @regression @P1
  Scenario: Registering the same GitHub username twice does not duplicate
    Given a developer already exists with github_username "gaearon" and techs "Node.js"
    When I submit a registration with github_username "gaearon", techs "ReactJS", latitude "-23.5505" and longitude "-46.6333"
    Then the response status should be 200
    And exactly 1 developer with github_username "gaearon" should exist in the database
    And the developer's techs should be "Node.js"

  @regression @P2
  Scenario: Techs string parsing trims whitespace
    Given "gaearon" is a valid GitHub username
    When I submit a registration with github_username "gaearon", techs " ReactJS ,  Node.js,Redux ", latitude "-23.5505" and longitude "-46.6333"
    Then the response status should be 200
    And the developer's techs should be "ReactJS,Node.js,Redux"

  @edge @P1
  Scenario: Missing github_username is rejected
    When I submit a registration with github_username "", techs "ReactJS", latitude "-23.5505" and longitude "-46.6333"
    Then the response status should indicate a client error

  @edge @P1
  Scenario: Non-existent GitHub username is rejected cleanly
    Given "ghost-user-does-not-exist-xyz" is not a valid GitHub username
    When I submit a registration with github_username "ghost-user-does-not-exist-xyz", techs "ReactJS", latitude "-23.5505" and longitude "-46.6333"
    Then the response status should indicate a client error
    And no developer with github_username "ghost-user-does-not-exist-xyz" should be persisted
