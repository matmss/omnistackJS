Feature: Search developers by location and tech
  As a developer using DevRadar
  I want to find nearby developers who know specific technologies
  So that I can network with them

  Background:
    Given the developer database is empty
    And the following developers exist:
      | github_username | techs             | latitude  | longitude  |
      | near-match       | ReactJS,Node.js   | -23.5505  | -46.6333   |
      | near-no-tech     | Python            | -23.5506  | -46.6334   |
      | far-match        | ReactJS           | -22.9068  | -43.1729   |

  @smoke @P1
  Scenario: Search returns only nearby developers with a matching tech
    When I search at latitude "-23.5505", longitude "-46.6333" for techs "ReactJS"
    Then the response should contain exactly 1 developer
    And the response should include "near-match"
    And the response should not include "far-match"
    And the response should not include "near-no-tech"

  @regression @P3
  Scenario: Search with a tech nobody has returns an empty list
    When I search at latitude "-23.5505", longitude "-46.6333" for techs "COBOL"
    Then the response should contain exactly 0 developers
